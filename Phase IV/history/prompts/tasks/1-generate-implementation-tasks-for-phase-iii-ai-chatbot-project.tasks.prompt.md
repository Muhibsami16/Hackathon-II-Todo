## Prompt

create at this location E:\HACKATHON-II\Phase III always not at this
  E:/HACKATHON-II/specs/001-chatbot/spec.md" in specs folder where plan.md and specs.md already created

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for Phase III AI Chatbot & MCP Integration project. The tasks are organized by user story (P1, P2, P3) with 75 total tasks across 7 phases. All tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential Task IDs, story labels, and exact file paths. The plan includes setup, foundational components, core chat functionality, context maintenance, MCP-only operations, edge case handling, and polish phases. Parallel execution opportunities identified and independent test criteria provided for each phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created with all user stories mapped to implementation tasks
- 🧪 Tests: Independent test criteria defined for each phase and user story
- 🗁 Files: Created tasks.md with comprehensive implementation tasks
- 🔄 Next prompts: Ready for agent-based implementation of tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully translated implementation plan into detailed, executable tasks following format requirements
